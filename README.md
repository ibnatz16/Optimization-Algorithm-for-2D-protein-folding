* matplotlib 3.0.3

## Overview
In this repository we implement a genetic algorithm to optimize for hydrophobic contact points in 2D protein folding. A sequence of amino acids is read from a fasta file and passed through a genetic algorithm parameterized through command line arguments (see usage). <br/>

## Usage <br/>
    python3 GeneticAlgorithm.py <filename> <population size> <number of iterations> <percent nonrandom selection> <mutation rate>
Percent nonrandom selection and mutation rate should be entered as decimals between 0 and 1
#### Example:
    python3 GeneticAlgorithm.py rcsb_pdb_4BWD.fasta 15 14 0.4 0.0005

## File Structure / Naming Convention <br/>
This repository has the following file structure:<br/>

Plots of the folding for every sequence in every generation can be found in `folding/generations/`. `folding/outputs/` will contain a maximum of 10 similar plots from randomly chosen sequences of the first and last generation of the algorithm. Plots of fitness vs iterations can be found in `fitness/`.<br/><br/>
Plots in `folding/generations/` will be named according to: `<fasta filename>_<population size>_<percent nonrandom selection>_<mutation rate>_gen_<generation number>_seq_<sequence number>.png`<br/><br/>
Plots in `folding/outputs/` will be named according to:  `<fasta filename>_<population size>_<percent nonrandom selection>_<mutation rate>_<plot number>.png`<br/><br/>
Plots in `fitness/` will be named according to: `<fasta filename>_<population size>_<percent nonrandom selection>_<mutation rate>.png`<br/>

## Outputs
The following plots were obtained from the following command: `python3 GeneticAlgorithm.py test.fasta 10 20 .90 0.05`.
